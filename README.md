# Ventilation-Presssure-Prediction
Pressure prediction for Ventilating Systems: With this project we aim to overcome the drawbacks of conventional mechanical ventilators, by simulating a ventilator connected to a sedated patient's lung. By adapting to a patient, this model could predict the right airway pressure of his lungs at a certain point in time.
